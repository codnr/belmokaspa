Webpage creation for Mocha

# Issues

    1. Does the contact us email even work?
    2. Should we hide the social links not being used through css?
    3. Should we just rewrite this site from scratch?
    4. Site needs to be optimized by removing comments and minifying code.
    5. Site needs more audits.
    6. Site maybe needs https? can it be done?
    7. Remove the home link because the logo icon is a link to home?
